# Node2Vec Experiments Repository

## Introduction

- This repository serves as a workspace for experimenting with Random Walk techniques on various graph datasets.
  - The technique includes deepwalk, node2vec, and node2vec with pagerank algorithm.

## Dataset

- For your experiments, you can use any graph dataset, and in this example, I use the well-known Citation Network dataset.
  - torch_geometric.datasets, Planetoid

## Directory Structure

- scripts/: contains script files that run random walk technique
- src/: contains the source code for your experiments.
- results/: Save the results as csv.
