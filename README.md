# Node2Vec Experiments Repository

## Introduction

- This repository serves as a workspace for experimenting with Node2Vec techniques on various graph datasets. Node2Vec is a powerful algorithm for learning continuous representations of nodes in a graph, and this repository provides a
  starting point for conducting experiments, trials, and analyses.

## Dataset

- For your experiments, you can use any graph dataset, and in this example, I use the well-known Cora dataset.
  - Download the Cora dataset [here](https://linqs-data.soe.ucsc.edu/public/lbc/cora.tgz) and extract the files.

## Directory Structure

- dataset/: Store your graph datasets here.
- src/: Contains the source code for your experiments.
- results/: Save the results and trained models here.
